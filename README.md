Code inspired by the book "Creating Symmetry - The Artful Mathematics of Wallpaper Patterns" by Frank A. Farris

Projects and extensions which I hope to eventually address:

1.  Using an ndarray/tensor framework like Tensorflow, MXNet, or PyTorch, this code could be speeded up significantly.
2.  It would be an interesting project to develop similar code for creating symmetric functions on the sphere for use in virtual reality (Gear VR, Rift, etc.)
3.  An even more ambitious VR-based project would be a visualization of functions invariant under the 3d space groups.  These functions would be functions on R^3 which we could approximate by colored voxel arrays, i.e. the 3d analogue of images.  But how to visualize these voxel arrays in VR?  One way would be to situate the viewer at the center of a translatable, rotatable, expandable/contractible sphere.  The sphere would be colored by the voxels which it intersects.
4.  Use this wallpaper code to generate training data for a deep learning "symmetry detector/classifier."
