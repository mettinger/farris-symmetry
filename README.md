# farris-symmetry
Code inspired by the book "Creating Symmetry - The Artful Mathematics of Wallpaper Patterns" by Frank A. Farris

Comments:

1.  It would be an interesting project to use a tensor framework like Tensorflow, MXNet, or PyTorch to speed up this code.
2.  It would be an interesting project to develop similar code for the Sphere for use in virtual reality.
